      <h2>About CoreFlex</h2>
      <p>
        CoreFlex Apparel was born from a passion for fitness and a desire to create gym wear that moves with you not against you. We understand that every workout is a journey of strength, determination, and self-confidence. That's why we design activewear that combines cutting-edge performance fabrics with modern style to empower you every step of the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is simple: to provide high-quality, durable, and comfortable gym clothing that supports your goals, whether you're an elite athlete or just starting your fitness journey. We test every product rigorously to ensure it stands up to the toughest workouts while keeping you looking sharp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sustainability is also at the heart of what we do. CoreFlex is committed to using eco-friendly materials and ethical manufacturing processes because we believe taking care of the planet is just as important as taking care of yourself.
